Examples
========

.. include:: ../_includes/contents.rst

We prepared some examples of menus. They are sorted by difficult:

:Simple menus: Menus with minimum features and required knowledges to repeat it by yourself.
:Medium menus: Menus with using some not so difficult features, like variables, or more complex logical structures.
:Advanced menus: Menus with advanced features using, like templates, animations, etc.

.. attention:: All these examples works only with Spigot 1.13 and higher! So, here we used 1.13+ material names.
