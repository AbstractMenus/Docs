Placeholders
============

.. include:: ../_includes/contents.rst

Placeholder is a part of text concluded between ``%`` chars.

The plugin supports placeholders in any parameter of the item, action, rule and in some activators. It doesnâ€™t matter what data type the parameter accepts.

If the parameter accepts a number, and a placeholder inserted instead of it also returns a number, this will work. Therefore, if you use placeholders for numeric types, make sure that it is replaced with a number, otherwise, there will be an error.

There are default built in AM and third-party (PlaceholderAPI) placeholders.

Built-in placeholders
---------------------

.. csv-table::

If you have installed `PlaceholderAPI <https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/6245/>`_, some of this placeholder won't work and will be replaced by big variety of placeholders from third party plugin instead. **Special placeholders** always works both with PAPI and without it.

Example of using placeholders
-----------------------------

Below is some examples of using placeholders in menu.

In commands
~~~~~~~~~~~

::

	command {
	  console: "give %player_name% minecraft:diamond_sword"
	}


In items
~~~~~~~~

::

	itemAdd {
	  slot: 0
	  material: STONE
	  name: "&e%player_name% stone"
	}


Placeholders for variables
--------------------------

There are more placeholders to discover e.g. :ref:`placeholders for variables <vars-access>` to get a variable value. You can use them whether you've installed PlaceholderAPI or not.

.. _value-extractors:

Value extractors
----------------

.. important:: Value Extractors **are not independent placeholders**, like ``%player_name%``. They can be used only in some context, like Activator's context or inside generated menus. To know how use extractors as placeholders, see :doc:`../advanced/input` article.

Sometimes AbstractMenus may save some context data. 
For example, when player opened menu with ``clickBlock`` activator, plugin saves block on which player clicked. Activator's placeholders allows you to get access to some context data properties via placeholders. This is possible thanks to the Value Extractors.

For each data exists own extractor that can accept limited amount of placeholders. Below described all extractors and placeholder which they can accept.

.. _extractor-block:
