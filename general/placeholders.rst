Placeholders
============

.. include:: ../_includes/contents.rst

Placeholder is a part of text concluded between ``%`` chars.

The plugin supports placeholders in any parameter of the item, action, rule, and activator. It doesnâ€™t matter what data type the parameter accepts. 

If the parameter accepts a number, and a placeholder inserted instead of it also returns a number, this will work. Therefore, if you use placeholders for numeric types, make sure that it is replaced with a number, otherwise, there will be an error.

There are default built in AM and third-party (PlaceholderAPI) placeholders.

Built-in placeholders
