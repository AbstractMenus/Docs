Auto reload
-----------

While you developing your menus, you usually use ``/am reload`` command to load changed menu files. 
AbstractMenus has ability to do it automatically. Just write ``/am serve`` and plugin will listen for files updates and reload changed or created menus automatically. This action will work every time when you create or save file inside ``menus`` folder.

To disable it, just write ``/am serve`` again.

.. warning:: This feature preffered only while you actively writing menus. Do not use it after server release.
